Q. What is blockchain?
- Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
- A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger(record or account book) of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

Q. Overview of blockchain?
- Blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network.
- Blockchain is a technology that enables Bitcoin and is also applied to many business processes.
- Blockchain not only performs transactions but also ensures anonymity(anonymous) and security of the users.

Q. History of blockchain?
- (1990) The concept of distributed ledgers has been around since 1990.

# Blockchain in Banking System:
@ Issues in Banking System:
1. High transaction cost
2. Account hacking
3. Net frauds
4. Financial Crisis

@ Blockchain solution for the issues:
1. Decentralized System
2. Distributed Ledger
3. Incentives of Validation
4. Consensus(a general agreement) Algorithm
5. Cryptography(art of writing or solving codes) Algorithm

# Blockchain Transaction Process:
1. Transaction is requested
2. Transaction is broadcasted
3. Transaction is validated by the Minter
4. Transaction becomes a part of the new block created
5. New block is added to the Blockchain
6. Transaction is now completed

# Steps of Blockchain Transaction:
- Blockchain transaction works by implementing one of the following features in each step:
1. Cryptography Algorithm
2. Decentralized Network
3. Consensus Mechanism
4. Distributed Ledger

# Features of Blockchain:
1. Cryptography: 
- Plaintext(Readable format Non-encrypted data)
- Encryption
- Ciphertext(Non-readable format Encrypted data)
- Decryption
- Plaintext(Readable format Non-encrypted data)

- There are two kinds of Cryptography:
1. Asymmetric Key Cryptography:
- Asymmetric key cryptography uses two kinds of keys public key and private key.
- Plain text -> Encrypts message using public key -> Cipher text -> Decrypts message using private key -> Plain text

2. Symmetric Key Cryptography:
- Symmetric key cryptography uses only one key which is the secret key used for both encryption and decryption.
- Plain text -> Encrypt message using the same key -> Cipher text -> Decrypt message using the same key -> Plain text

Q. What is Digital Signature?
- Public Key + Private Key = Digital Signature
- A digital signature provides authentication and validation like normal signatures.
- It ensures the security and integrity of data recorded on the Blockchain.
- It uses asymmetric cryptography in which information can be shared using a public key.
- Primary keys are linked to users providing digital signatures a quality of nonrepudiation. 

# Consensus Protocol:
- It is a fault-tolerant protocol that is used to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of network.
- It is a set of rules that decides on the contribution of the various participants of the Blockchain.
- It ensures that all transactions occuring on the network are genuine and all participants agree on the consensus of the ledger.

# Features of Consensus Protocol:
- Efficient 
- Secure
- Real-time
- Reliable
- Functional 

# Blockchain Block Structure:
- Header: Contains version information, nonce, previous block id, and timestamp.
- Merkle: Is a hash built from the block's transaction identifiers.
- List of records: Is an identification of hashes that were included into the block's Merkle tree.

# Blockchain Identifiers:
1. Block Header:
- Primary identifier of a block
- Digital fingerprint, twice the size of a block header
- Unique identification of a block of 32-byte hash

2. Block Height:
- Position of the block in Blockchain
- The first block is of height 0
- Each node dynamically identifies a block

# Blockchain Merkle Tree:
- Data structure used for summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data.
- It is also known as Binary Hash Tree.

# Advantages of Merkle Tree:
- Integrity
- Less memory required
- Proofs are computed quickly and easily
- Provides validation of data
- Less information required

# Distributed Ledger:
- Ledgers store the copy of transactions that have taken place. Every single person of the network has a copy of the ledger.
- Example:
> John = 3 BTC (John has 3 BTC)
> John => Kat 3 BTC (John gives 3 BTC to Kat)
> Kat => Peter 2 BTC (Kat gives 2 BTC to Peter)
> Peter => Susan 1 BTC (Peter gives 1 BTC to Susan)
- They will all have a similar copy of these transactions.

# Evolution of Ledgers:
- Clay tablets > Papyrus > Tally sticks > Double entry book keeping > Spreadsheets > Distributed ledger

# Features of Blockchain in Transaction Process:
- Cryptographic Algorithm > Decentralized System > Validation by Miner > Block Creation > Proof of Work > Distributed Ledger

# Types of Blockchain: 
1. Public:
- Bitcoin > Ethereum > Dash > Factom
- Ledgers are publicly available to verify or add blocks to the Blockchain.
- Public Blockchains can receive and send transactions to anybody in the world.
- They can be audited by anyone and every node on the network has the same amount of transmission power.

2. Private: 
- Only authorized users can add or verify the blocks, but anyone can view it.
- A private Blockchain is a closed network that offers its participants the benefit of the technology.
- Example of private Blockchain: MultiChain, Blockstack.

3. Consortium:
- Only a predefined set of nodes has permission to write the block, since it is a semi-centralized Blockchain.
- Example of consortium nodes in the Blockchain world are: Hyperledger 1.0, R3, Ripple.

# Blockchain Platforms:
- ethereum [Largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin]
- r3 [Distributed ledger-based platform]
- ripple [Cross-border payments]
- Chain [Blockchain-based cloud infrastructure]
@ Other Blockchain Platforms:
- Hyperledger [Consortium network for enterprise Blockchain applications]
- IOTA [Backs nano payments]
- openchain [Open source, enterprise-ready Blockchain platform]
- Quorum [Majority voting consensus mechanism]

# Blockchain Application Components:
1. Node Application:
- Each node has to install and run a computer application definitive to the ecosystem.

2. Shared Ledger: 
- A ledger is managed inside the node application whose contents can be viewed once the application is running.

3. Consensus Algorithm:
- It provides the rule for how the ecosystem will arrive at a single view in a ledger, and how it will be implemented as a part of node application.

4. Virtual Machine:
- An abstraction of instruction-operated machine implemented as a part of the node application.

# Blockchain Application Templates:
1. Many-to-One:
- Used for applications where a user sets up the contracts for a specific purpose.

2. One-to-One:
- Used for applications which involve financial contracts between two entities.
