Q. What is cryptocurrency?
- A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is meant to be a medium of exchange.

# Features of cryptocurrency:
- There's a limit to how many units can exist
(with Bitcoin this limit exists at 21 million after this no more Bitcoins will be produced)
- Easily verifies the transfer of funds
- Operating independent of a bank
- Allows new units to be added only after certain conditions are met 

Q. What makes cryptocurrencies special?
- Little to no transaction costs
- 24/7 access to money 
- No limit on purchases and withdrawals
- Freedom for anyone to use
- International transactions are faster

Q. What's the 'Crypto' in Cryptocurrencies?
- Cryptography is a method of using encryption and decryption to secure communication in the presence of third parties with ill intent.
- Cryptography usually requires a computational algorithm (like SHA256), a public key (that the user shares with everyone) and a private key (which acts like a digital signature of the user)

@ A normal bitcoin transaction:
- Transaction details > SHA256 > Passed through a signature algorithm with the user's private key > Digitally signed output > Distributing the output across the network with sender's public key > Verification and being added to a block

@ There are two major cryptocurrencies (among the many) in the market: Bitcoin and Ether
- Bitcoin is a form of digital currency and is decentralized without a central bank. It uses blockchain to perform transactions on a peer-to-peer network.
- Ether is a currency that's accepted in the Ethereum network. Ethereum works on blockchain technology to create an open source platform to build and deploy decentralized applications.

Q. Difference between Bitcoin and Ether?
# Bitcoin:
- It is used to send money to someone.
- Bitcoin transactions are manual.
- It takes 10 minutes to perform a transaction.(slow)
- It is used like money, for real world transactions.
- There's a limit to how many bitcoins can exist: 21,000,000.
- Used for transactions involving goods and services.
- It uses an algorithm known as SHA256 for hashing(which is a process of obtaining the address of block).
- "SHA256 has 64 hexadecimal characters. Each character is of 4 bits. So in total it has 64*4 bits i.e. 256 bits."
- "1 byte = 8 bit"

# Ether:
- It is used as a currency in the Ethereum network.
- Transactions are manual or automatic.
- It takes about 20 seconds to finish a transaction.(fast)
- Ether is used to power the Ethereum network and power real life transactions. 
- Ether is expected to be continuous but not expected to exceed 100,000,000.
- Uses blockchain to create a ledger that triggers a transaction when a condition is met.
- Ethereum uses the ethash algorithm for hashing.

Q. What's the future of cryptocurrency?
- Conflict between regulation and anonymity.
- Futurists believe by 2030, cryptocurrencies would occupy 25% of national currencies.
- Increased acceptance by merchants and customers.
- It will continue to have a volatile nature.
